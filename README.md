# GSoC 2025 Proposal – Interactive Neuroimaging Visualization in Jupyter Notebooks

This repository is for my GSoC 2025 proposal under **INCF**, aimed at building intuitive and interactive neuroimaging visualization tools within Jupyter Notebooks.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The goal is to improve the accessibility and storytelling of brain data by:
- Supporting 2D and 3D brain visualizations
- Using libraries like `nilearn`, `nibabel`, `plotly`, and `ipympl`
- Making neuroimaging easier to explore, especially for students and early-stage researchers

## 📅 Timeline Highlights
- Explore NIfTI and BIDS data formats
- Build visual plotting functions
- Integrate interactivity for time-series and statistical maps
- Document tools with use-case examples

## ⚙️ Technologies
- Python, Jupyter Notebooks
- NiBabel, Nilearn, Plotly, ipywidgets
- Neuroimaging data (NIfTI format)

## 📄 Proposal Document
Full proposal is available [here](link-to-proposal).

## 🎯 Why This Project?
I enjoy visualizing data and making it accessible. This project is a great way to support reproducibility in neuroscience while learning deeply about brain data formats.
